# Processing - Jaime

This repository contains Processing3 scripts that I have done during my free time.

Some considerations:

* The scripts are writte in **Python 3**.
* In order to execute them you must install [Processing 3](https://processing.org/).
* Most of the scripts are useless and only have aesthetic purposes.
* You are completely free to download, modify and distribute them freely according to the MIT Liscense

## Physics
### r_walk.pyde

With a click you can create a series of random walkers that move in a box. 
The box has cyclic boundary conditions so the number of walkers remains constant. 
There is also a histogram that shows the number of walkers in #x# and #y# showing how the distribution in always gaussian

## Curves
### circle_lights.pyde

With a click you can create a point that moves appears to move randomly in a curvy way
The movement is created using chained circles that rotate with a fixed angular velocity
