# Processing - Jaime

This repository contains Processing3 scripts that I have done during my free time.

Some considerations:

* The scripts are writte in **Python 3**.
* In order to execute them you must install [Processing 3](https://processing.org/).
* Most of the scripts are useless and only have aesthetic purposes.
* You are completely free to download, modify and distribute them freely according to the MIT Liscense
